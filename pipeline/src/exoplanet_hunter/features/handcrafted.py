"""Hand-crafted scalar features extracted from a phase-folded view.

These feed the Random Forest baseline (DATA 305 Week 2 — ensembles). The set
is deliberately small and interpretable: a domain expert can read each
feature and explain why it should help separate transits from false positives.

Compare to the CNN, which learns its own features from the raw view.
