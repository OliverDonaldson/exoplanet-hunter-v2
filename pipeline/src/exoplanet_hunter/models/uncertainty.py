"""Uncertainty estimation via MC Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani 2016).

Standard Keras dropout is disabled at inference. By calling the model with
`training=True` repeatedly and averaging predictions, we sample from the
*posterior predictive distribution* — giving us both a mean prediction and
a calibrated standard deviation.

This is critical when claiming "this signal could be a planet": a high mean
score with low std is a confident detection; the same mean with a wide std is
a candidate that needs follow-up.
